# Operation Neusploit (APT28) / CVE-2026-21509 OSINT Report
Date: 2026-02-04

## Executive Summary
- Operation Neusploit is an APT28-attributed campaign exploiting CVE-2026-21509 via weaponized RTF files to deliver two distinct malware chains: MiniDoor (Outlook VBA email theft) and PixyNetLoader (loader for Covenant Grunt).
- Targeting is concentrated in Central and Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Slovakia, Romania), with localized lures and server-side geofencing and User-Agent validation; geofence testing shows access only from CZ/PL/RO.
- CVE-2026-21509 is a Microsoft Office security feature bypass (CVSS 7.8) and is listed in CISA KEV with a 2026-02-16 remediation due date.
- CERT-UA reporting (via secondary sources) links active exploitation to malicious lures sent to Ukrainian government bodies and EU-linked organizations.
- The exploit chain is stealthy by design: malformed embedded OLE objects are reconstructed in memory during Word parsing, bypassing trust checks without macros or external templates and evading many static scanners and MOTW-based controls.
- The PixyNetLoader branch uses COM hijacking + scheduled task orchestration to restart Explorer, then loads a DLL that extracts stego shellcode from a PNG, applies anti-analysis timing checks, and executes a Covenant Grunt implant.
- Bottom line: APT28 is using a low-interaction Office parsing flaw to gain mailbox access and persistent footholds, with regional gating and short-lived infrastructure. Prioritize Office patching and hunt for the RTF-to-dropper chain plus COM hijack persistence and steganographic payloads.

## Incident Overview (What is confirmed)
- Operation Neusploit is a live, in-the-wild campaign leveraging weaponized RTF files to exploit CVE-2026-21509 in Microsoft Office.
- The activity is attributed to APT28 based on victimology, tooling, and technique overlap.
- Microsoft issued an out-of-band update on 2026-01-26; active exploitation was observed on 2026-01-29.
- The vulnerability is a security feature bypass in Office (CWE-807) with CVSS 7.8 and KEV inclusion.
- Victims include Ukrainian government bodies and EU-linked organizations, with lures themed around EU consultations and regional topics.
- The operation’s objectives align with APT28’s espionage posture: credentialed access to mailboxes (MiniDoor) and persistent C2 via Covenant for follow-on collection and lateral operations.

## Timeline (from public sources)
- 2026-01-26: Microsoft releases out-of-band update for CVE-2026-21509 (actively exploited).
- 2026-01-27: CERT-UA identifies lure document metadata dated 2026-01-27.
- 2026-01-29: Active exploitation observed; CERT-UA records weaponized lures in Ukraine.
- 2026-02-02: Zscaler publishes the Operation Neusploit analysis.
- 2026-02-03: Independent reporting (Synaptic Systems, GBHackers, and multiple news outlets) expands technical coverage and IOC lists, including geofencing analysis and hash sets.

## Attack Path (likely mechanics)
- Initial access uses weaponized RTF/DOC lures exploiting CVE-2026-21509, delivered via email with localized social engineering themes.
- The exploit abuses RTF `\\object`/`\\objdata` reconstruction to embed malformed OLE objects; Word rebuilds them in memory and makes trust decisions on attacker-controlled metadata, evading static scanners and MOTW-style checks.
- The document itself carries no payload. It serves as a trigger to reach a trust-decision state where Office permits access to remote shortcut objects without user prompts or macro execution.
- WebDAV LNK access uses `file://.../davwwwroot/...lnk?init=1` paths to force Office into file-system semantics; LNKs then stage droppers, with geofencing limiting access to specific regions (CZ/PL/RO).
- Staging domains resolved to IP space in Romania and Moldova during analysis, reinforcing region-targeted infrastructure selection.
- Server-side evasion only serves malicious DLLs to targeted geographies with specific User-Agent values.
- Variant 1 dropper deploys MiniDoor, an Outlook VBA project that forwards victim emails; registry changes lower Outlook macro protections to allow auto-load on startup.
- MiniDoor deployment uses a DLL export (`UIClassRegister`) to install the VBA project, monitors Outlook login/mail events, and forwards selected folders to attacker-controlled mailboxes.
- Variant 2 dropper (PixyNetLoader) drops `EhStoreShell.dll` and `SplashScreen.png`, establishes COM hijacking persistence, and uses a scheduled task to trigger `explorer.exe` reload.
- The `EhStoreShell.dll` loader extracts shellcode hidden via PNG steganography in `SplashScreen.png`, then loads a .NET Covenant Grunt implant; Filen API is used as a C2 bridge in the chain.
- PixyNetLoader uses a rolling XOR key for payload decryption and CLR hosting to execute the Covenant .NET payload after stego extraction.
- CERT-UA reporting indicates a WebDAV-based download step from the lure document before the PixyNetLoader chain.
- PixyNetLoader’s scheduled task (`OneDriveHealth`) uses `schtasks.exe` to restart Explorer and then self-delete; the loader only executes when hosted in `explorer.exe` and uses a sleep-timing check to detect sandboxing.
- The PixyNetLoader dropper checks for the presence of `%ProgramData%\\USOPublic\\Data\\User\\EhStoreShell.dll` before running its main logic; if present, it aborts, which can explain partial chains on re-infection.

## Impact & Blast Radius Analysis
### Impact (technical)
- Successful exploitation enables email theft (MiniDoor) and a full-featured C2 implant (Covenant Grunt), with stealth via COM hijacking, scheduled tasks, and steganography.
- MiniDoor focuses on persistent mailbox access, while PixyNetLoader enables broader post-exploitation operations through Covenant’s command set and staging.
### Operational Objectives
- The campaign’s primary objective is intelligence collection: persistent access to victim mailboxes and continued endpoint access to support follow-on collection and operational pivoting.
- The use of regional geofencing and localized lures indicates deliberate target selection over broad opportunistic spraying.

### Blast Radius (who is exposed)
- Primary targeting is Central/Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Slovakia, Romania) with localized lures in Romanian, Slovak, Ukrainian, and English.
- CERT-UA reporting indicates Ukrainian government bodies and EU-linked organizations received malicious lures, including campaigns sent to 60+ government-related addresses.

## Detection & Validation Guidance
- Signal: RTF/DOC exploitation with no macros or external relationships in static scans. Evidence: access to `file://.../davwwwroot/...lnk?init=1` from Office, WebClient activity, and follow-on DLL retrieval.
- Signal: MiniDoor deployment. Evidence: creation of `%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Outlook\\VbaProject.OTM`, Outlook registry downgrades, and mail forwarding behavior in `Inbox`, `RssFeeds`, `Junk`, and `Drafts`.
- Signal: PixyNetLoader staging. Evidence: `SplashScreen.png` in `%ProgramData%\\Microsoft OneDrive\\setup\\Cache\\`, `EhStoreShell.dll` in `%ProgramData%\\USOPublic\\Data\\User\\`, and `office.xml` in `%Temp%\\Diagnostics\\`.
- Signal: Persistence via COM hijack and scheduled task. Evidence: CLSID `{D9144DCD-E998-4ECA-AB6A-DCD83CCBA16D}` `InProcServer32` set to dropped `EhStoreShell.dll`, and task `OneDriveHealth` created then deleted after restarting `explorer.exe`.
- Signal: Covenant staging and C2. Evidence: CLR hosting behavior, outbound traffic to Filen API, and associated beaconing.

## Mitigations & Hardening
- Apply Microsoft’s emergency updates for CVE-2026-21509 and enforce restarts for Office 2021+ to activate service-side protections.
- For Office 2016/2019, prioritize patching and apply Microsoft’s mitigation guidance if updates are delayed.
- Office 2016/2019 patch guidance in public reporting lists build 16.0.5539.1001 (Office 2016) and 16.0.10417.20095 (Office 2019) for both x86/x64.
- Reinforce attachment hygiene: avoid opening Office files from unknown or untrusted sources while exploitation is active.
- Disable or tightly control WebClient where operationally feasible to reduce WebDAV attack surface, and monitor for `file://.../davwwwroot` access patterns in endpoint telemetry.
